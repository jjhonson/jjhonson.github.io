**Goal 1** - Prepare GitHub to orient our work (what we build and how we sell it) around target customer segments
- **Why**: We need better connections and processes between how we build product and how we sell it.  Without this, it is difficult to prioritize across product opportunities or create effective selling programs that can reliably result in growth.  Organizing a product marketing function around the ["whole product"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_product) we sell to each customer segment and the plan to grow our business with each segment is - in part - how we'll accomplish this.
- **Goal type**: Process creation / improvement
- **Dependencies**:
  - Alignment with product management both in philosophy (we view and understand our customers the same way) and practice (we prioritize and organize our product roadmap around these plans to grow our business with each segment)
  - Alignment within marketing and sales disciplines - commitment to sell within the same structure that drives what we build
- **Measurement**:
  - Publish and alignment around market segments with templates and process in place for measurement of the health of our relationship with them (do we have the right product? do we have the right marketing plan?)
  - Inbound input into product management is coming through the lens of these segments and in customer voice (not prescriptive asks for specific features)
  - We have a finite and clear number of building blocks for our strategic growth plan and can evaluate overall health of our business in the sum of our segment growth plans
- **Monthly milestones**:
  - by April 30: coordination and sharing across segment definition and growth plan development that has already happened (Education 2016 plan, Government, Financial Services)
 - by May 31:
    - Complete segmentation framework and get broad buy-in within the product / marketing team
    - Build out templates and at least 3 working examples of segment definition, insights, current business and growth plans, value prop, etc. for each
 - by June 30:
   - Orient the product marketing team org structure fully around segment orientation as we defined it (more specifically around the "whole product" we sell to each segment)
   - Work with product management to be able to prioritize needs across segments and nail down working relationships within the context of this structure
   - Launch at least one product leveraging the framework, structure and insights we have built

**Goal 2** - Improvement of GTM planning and execution
 - **Why**: We have a long way to go to become the marketing team we want to be where we're able to align around a specific set of objectives, organize and plan and the work tightly and efficiently together to deliver them
 - **Goal type**: Process creation / improvement
 - **Dependencies**:
   - We need everyone on the same page about the kind of marketing team we're building (both within the team and partners)
   - Broad buy-in around the need to work together in a consistent way
   - Alignment on goals and priorities across product and marketing
 - **Measurement**:
   - More effective product launches: goals are known, measured and achieved
   - Better support for, and output from, creative teams: we will give creative teams enough time to do their work at a high level of quality.  All major launches / marketing events will be buttoned up (creative complete) at least one week before launch to allow for review, bug fixing, etc.
   - Company is aligned around non-product brand-level communication - why, when and how we want to speak to customers (editorial calendar)
 - **Monthly milestones**:
  - by April 30:
    - Completion of GTM / messaging plan for Pricing launch (achievement of launch goals to be measured in May)
    - Completion of GTM / messaging plan for Enterprise 2.6
    - Completion of GTM / messaging plan for Electron 1.0
  - by May 31:
    - Completion of GTM / messaging plan for GitHub Cloud (well in advance of launch - with aligned objectives and structure)
    - Completion of GTM / messaging plan for Enterprise 2.7 (well in advance of launch - with aligned objectives and structure)
    - Standard templates and process around product packaging (messaging framework, core collateral, etc.)
  - by June 30:

**Goal 3** - Build out  the structure of Marketing, Product Marketing, Video and Content as functions at GitHub
  - **Why**: As new disciplines, not used to working together, there is a significant investment to be made in purpose, focus, process and measurement in order to build functions that will serve the company for years to come
  - **Goal type**: Organization structure
  - **Dependencies**:
    - Tight alignment and partnership with marketing leadership
    - Support and patience from product, sales and other partners
  - **Measurement**:
    - Employee NPS or similar (need a baseline)
    - Marketing productivity and scope (need to determine measurement but we should be able to cover more ground / marketer)
  - **Monthly milestones**:
    - by April 30:
      - "Video team of the future" - purpose, structure, output and resource needs for the Video team we're building
      - Team post -
    - by May 31:
      - "Writing at GitHub" - manual of style, editorial calendar (document and process in place and functioning)
      - Marketing priorities for 2016 (coming out of the product priorities exercise)
    - by June 30:
      - tbd


  **Goal 4** - Deep learning of GitHub products, community and customers
   - **Why**: I don't come from a developer background and want to start building some better empathy for the experiences and needs of developers by going through all of our tools, processes and community from their perspective
   - **Goal type**: Personal development
   - **Dependencies**:
     - None - as long as ridicule is kept to a minimum
   - **Measurement**:
     - Ultimately (before the end of this year) I want to learn enough code and be comfortable enough with GitHub and the community to make a contribution (of some modest value) to an open source project
     - Shorter term I will complete an online 40 hour bootcamp course in web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Node, etc) using as much of GitHub as I can in the process:
       - Using a GitHub Page to keep everything I work on as I learn: http://jjhonson.github.io
       - Using a Gist to keep notes on what works for me and what doesn't as I learn: https://gist.ghe.io/jjhonson/a1ccf06b8a6cd5e34d9cd47e3dfa8471
       - Using Atom (and a ton of packages) to write everything
       - Using GitHub desktop for Mac as my git client (at least until I can use the command line or figure my way around it)
       - Using this repo to keep everything: https://github.com/jjhonson/jjhonson.github.io
       - Eventually finding some projects on GitHub to get involved with
   - **Monthly milestones**:
     - by April 30:
       - Start the web development course and set up all of the tools I will use as I learn
      - by May 31:
        - Complete the web development course and then decide on next phase of my learning plan (assume I'll have a ton more to dig into)
      - by June 30:
        - Make a contribution of some kind to an open source project
        - Produce a "what I've learned about GitHub" document


  **Goal 5** - Product Marketing Culture goal

    Know your business - goal tbd
