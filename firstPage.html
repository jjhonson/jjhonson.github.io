    <p>The following excerpt comes from <strong>Matthew Futterman’s</strong> Players: The Story of Sports and Money, and the <em>Visionaries Who Fought</em> to Create a Revolution, released yesterday by Simon & Schuster. This excerpt tells the little-known story of NFL executives Frank Vuono and Mike Ornstein, who attempted to thwart the NFL Players Association’s strategy of financing antitrust litigation with revenue from jersey sales by convincing top quarterbacks to instead sign their marketing rights over to the league.</p>
