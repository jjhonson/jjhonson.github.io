        <h2>Brand new blog</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I got tired of writing in a Gist (the old Gist is <a href="https://gist.ghe.io/jjhonson/a1ccf06b8a6cd5e34d9cd47e3dfa8471">here</a>)... that's really not made for blogging as it turns out.  I was thinking about a few ways to do this but landed on just making my own blog with html and css.  This is definitely not the best way to do it - and I'm already building up a bunch of tech debt on this project (for example, the nav-bar at the top is separately coded on each page and will be difficult to update as the site moves around - as it is doing a lot now)</li>
            <li>I'm now a lot further through the course than the last post more than 2 weeks ago.  I'm on lesson 156 of 285 - so more than half way through - and its really been great.</li>
            <li>I've gotten through the javascript section which was a little bit of a slog (lots of working in the console and not creating things that anyone can see) - but created a pretty <a href="../javascript2/colorGame.html">cool color game</a> with some interactive functionality.  So ... moving forward</li>
            <li>I'm in the section on jQuery now and its brought up a lot of questions about how much of this learning should be geared toward finding a coding job after you finish a course.  It seems to be the focus of most of these courses (understandable) - so it colors what and how I learn.  I'm not honestly sure its a good idea to learn shortcuts like jQuery when I honestly can barely remember any of the functions and arguments of the javascript I learned a week ago.  The instructor in this course talked a bit about it but includes jQuery because it is used in a lot of professional situations.  Will do my best to not let it push everything else I learned out of my head.</li>
            <li>Have worked on a few more tools - will come back later to write about that.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Finishing up CSS and HTML sections</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've finished the sections on html, css and bootstrap in my course and can now put together a website that looks like a poorly designed site that was built in the last 20 years - so that's some kind of progress.</li>
            <li>I've started trying out some different tools (Sublime text editor, different Git clients, etc.) but its amazing how quickly I've gotten attached to the tools I started on (considering I don't really know how to use them that well yet). For
                example, I know how to set up an automatic preview in Atom that changes as I code without having to switch over and refresh a browser window - and I couldn't immediately figure out how to do that in Sublime (there is an article on how
                to do it here that makes it seem way more complicated than Atom) - so I just bailed on it and went back to Atom. Maybe that will change when I'm more comfortable with the flow but for now its a significant switching cost.</li>
            <li>Moving on to javascript next which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I've also started exploring other ways people start learning to code:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/configure-your-code-portfolio">freeCodeCamp</a> - Seems a really cool idea learning to code with a bunch of other people and doing volunteer work for non-profits to practice - but its starting
                    over with "hello world" stuff and I don't want to go through all of that again - and the whole course "takes about 2,080 hours to earn all four of our certifications", which - unsuprisingly - nobody has ever done.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">Udacity Nanodegree Programs</a> - These seem really cool and I might try one when I'm done with this course (I'm only 26% complete). Looking a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">this one</a>                    since it has a GitHub tie in and hopefully not too advanced for me.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/education/classroom">GitHub Classroom</a> - I spoke to @johndbritton about this and I'm hoping I can find some "help wanted" issues that I can jump in on.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've started messing around with Bootstrap as part of the course and - now that I'm stealing other people's code - my projects are starting to look a ton better. I totally get that this is a huge time saver but I feel like there is a real
                danger that I would just steal code now that I have a basic understanding of how things work rather than really knowing how it works on my own.</li>
            <li>I was talking to John Britton and he suggested getting involved in the education/classroom project and starting making contributions there. Its a bit daunting but will poke around and see if there is anywhere I can dip my toe in the water.</li>
            <li>I tried two competitive products - both built on electron. Another Git client called GitKraken and a Markdown editor called Caret. I'm not sure I get the point of either one of them.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>GitKraken had a great onboarding tutorial which brought me through the steps of setting up the client a lot better than ours did - I mostly didn't know what I was doing but I got through it pretty fast. Big problem is that I can't see
                    what this does that's any different from the GitHub desktop app. It looks a little different and has a super cool landing page but otherwise I don't get it.</li>
                <li>Caret just isn't any better than Atom for me ... its maybe a little simpler but don't get why I would use another editor for markdown.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gists are clearly not meant for blogging like this. I need to figure out how they're meant to be used and start keeping this record somewhere else.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Updating project to GitHub</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've given up on the several step process of updating my github repo - my guess is that it is multi step to keep people from accidentally messing up production code (guessing people care more about their projects than I do). To be clearer
                though, here is the process I'm going through:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing code in Atom and saving the file to a folder on my computer</li>
                <li>Move that file into a file on my machine "jjhonson.github.io" which is cloned(?) on GitHub</li>
                <li>When I move or change a file it shows up in my GitHub desktop in "changed" column</li>
                <li>Then I "Commit to master" with some statement which will likely not make sense to me in the future (I assume people working together would want that message to be really descriptive so others could see what has changed)</li>
                <li>Then - I guess as one last fail-safe - I hit the Sync button.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Now that I've figured this out, it doesn't come across as difficult at all but it took me some time to figure it out.</li>
            <li>There is a command to "Open on GitHub" - but I'm not sure what that does yet and if it skips any of these steps.</li>
            <li>Beginning to work with CSS (have 5 exercises up on the page) and that's going really easy.</li>
            <li>Atom makes it pretty easy because I can frequently just start typing things I want to do and it will suggest the right tags or code. The live previews help a ton too.</li>
            <li>Everything is still pretty clunky but its coming along. The photo grid project is cool looking and significantly less embarassing than most of the other ones I've done.</li>
            <li>One thing driving me crazy - I have no idea how to move the stupid .gif on on my index page over to the middle of the page. I can style img tags but for some reason none of the styling seems to work on this. I was able to put an ugly green
                border around it - so there's that.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Have spent a few days now going through the first 35 lessons in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">Web Development course</a></li>
            <li>Today I’m trying to set up a GitHub page (jjhonson.github.io) to show the work and progress - it is really hard to work out:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I’m aware Pages exist because we’ve talked about them but I have to do a google search to find them - trying to find them is bringing me through all parts of GitHub I’ve never touched before</li>
                <li>The instructions on setting them up are pretty inaccessible - its asking me to use the GitHub Mac client but the screen shots aren’t the same</li>
                <li>The error messages are really hard to figure out - and I’m getting a bunch (email not set up, etc).</li>
                <li>Trying to upload an index file - took a lot of trial and error (could not figure out how to do it in the desktop client - did it on my computer and sync’d) but now I see it in the repo - however, the page isn’t rendering. Not sure what’s
                    wrong.</li>
                <li>Okay - worked when I put in jjhonson.github.io/index.html - not sure why the plain url isn’t redirecting like it says it will in the tutorial</li>
                <li>Okay - its working now. Maybe it just needed a little time to get working because I don’t think I did anything.</li>
                <li>I’ve got all of my practice projects (4 of them) up and a super simple index page to link to them - was able to figure out how to do this on GitHub desktop this time … its a multi-step process that I’m still not sure I understand but it
                    got up there</li>
                <li>Would be pretty cool if it were easier - no way could I have figured this out if I didn’t know what it was and what it was for ahead of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Why can’t I have more than one GitHub Pages Page? (Super weird that the name of the product is Pages and the thing I get I build with it is a “page”)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Would be cool to have one where I’m putting all of the stuff I do (practice pages) and then another one where I build a whole site on - I guess when I get that far I’ll have to pull all of the practice stuff down.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>
            <p><i>later in the day</i></p>
            <li>Started the CSS tutorial on the way home and now I can make web pages that look just like Geocities sites from 1996</li>
            <img src="http://bavatuesdays.com/files/2013/09/tumblr_mtc7kfdzOR1rlkewbo1_500.png" alt="Page looks a lot like this" />
            <li>I've figured out how to save all of my new files to the github.io folder and then they show up as changed in the GitHub desktop app ... its still a 4 step process for me and I'm sure there is an easier way.</li>
            <li>Atom has an "Open on GitHub" package - maybe that will help?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning Computers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Started the Web Developer Bootcamp online course from Udemy. I didn’t want to give it a ton of thought because I don’t think too many people getting started to code would do it that way (or at least fairly unorganized people like me) … so here’s why I chose this path:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I already had a Udemy account - I’ve never done a course but I have an account for some reason</li>
                <li>I spend 2 hours on the train every day and I can download lessons to my iPad and go through them while I’m commuting (where internet is super spotty)</li>
                <li>This course had a bunch of positive reviews and seemed like an in-depth introductory course covering a lot of things I wanted to learn (including covering Bootstrap)</li>
                <li>I chose web development to start learning. I have a super vague understanding that certain languages are <a href="https://www.codementor.io/learn-programming/beginner-programming-language-job-salary-community">more appropriate for certain applications</a> but I wanted something I could easily learn and apply</li>
