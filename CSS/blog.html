    <h2>Article about Arrested Development</h2>
    <p class="quote">Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City.</p>

    <p>George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. This was a big get for God. Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? You can always tell a Milford man.</p>

    <p>Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores.</p>
